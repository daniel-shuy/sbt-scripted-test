# scripted-scalatest-sbt-plugin

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/244276b4573e4ae899443fa79c34822b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/daniel-shuy/scripted-scalatest-sbt-plugin?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=daniel-shuy/scripted-scalatest-sbt-plugin&utm_campaign=badger)

A SBT plugin to use [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) with scripted-plugin to test your SBT plugins

Traditionally, to test a SBT plugin, you had to create subprojects in `/sbt-test`, then in the subprojects, create SBT tasks to perform the testing, then specify the tasks to execute in a `test` file (see http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html).

This is fine when performing simple tests, but for complicated tests (see http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html#step+6%3A+custom+assertion), this can get messy really quickly:
- It sucks to not be able to write tests in a BDD style (except by using comments, which feels clunky).
- Manually writing code to print the test results to the console for each subproject is a pain.

This plugin leverages ScalaTest's powerful assertion system (to automatically print useful messages on assertion failure) and its expressive DSLs.

This plugin allows you to use any of ScalaTest's test [Suites](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/selecting_a_style), including [AsyncTestSuites](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/async_testing).

__Warning__: Do not use ScalaTest's [ParallelTestExecution](http://doc.scalatest.org/3.0.0/index.html#org.scalatest.ParallelTestExecution) mixin with this plugin, unless you are absolutely sure your tests have no side effects.

## Note
When executing SBT tasks in tests, use `Project.runTask(<task>, state.value)` instead of `<task>.value`. That is because calling `<task>.value` declares it as a dependency, which executes before the tests, not when the line is called.

## Usage

### Step 1: Include the scripted-plugin in your build

See http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html#step+2%3A+scripted-plugin

If you are using [sbt-cross-building](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-cross-building), don't add scripted-plugin to `project/scripted.sbt`, and replace `ScriptedPlugin.scriptedSettings` in `scripted.sbt` with `CrossBuilding.scriptedSettings`.

### Step 2: Create the test subproject

Create the test subproject in `sbt-test/<test-group>/<test-name>`.

Include your plugin in the build.

See http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html#step+3%3A+src%2Fsbt-test

### Step 3: Include the plugin in your build

Add the following to your `sbt-test/<test-group>/<test-name>/project/plugins.sbt`:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.daniel-shuy" % "sbt-scripted-scalatest" % "0.1.0")
```

### Step 4: Configure `test` script

Put __only__ the following in the `test` script file:

`> scripted-scalatest`

### Step 5: Configure project settings for the plugin

Create a new ScalaTest Suite/Spec, mixin `ScriptedScalaTestSuiteMixin` and pass it into `scriptedScalaTestSpec`. When mixing in `ScriptedScalaTestSuiteMixin`, implement `sbtState` as `state.value`.

Example:
```scala
scriptedScalaTestSpec := Some(new WordSpec with ScriptedScalaTestSuiteMixin {
  override val sbtState: State = state.value
    
  "my-task" should {
    "do A" in {
      Project.runTask(myTask, state.value)
      // ...
      // assert(...)
    }
    
    "do B" in {
      Project.runTask(myTask, state.value)
      // ...
      // assert(...)
    }
  }
})
```

See [Settings](#settings) for other configurable settings.

### Step 6: Use the scripted-plugin as usual

Eg. Run `sbt scripted` on the main project to execute all tests.

Defaults to `true`.                                                                                                                                              |

## Tasks

| Task               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| scripted-scalatest | Executes all test configured in `scriptedScalaTestSpec`. This task must be [configured for scripted-plugin to run in the `test` script file](https://github.com/daniel-shuy/scripted-scalatest-sbt-plugin/new/master?readme=1#user-content-step-4-configure-test-script). |

## Known Issues

Currently, mixing in `BeforeAndAfter` into your ScalaTest Suite/Spec and implementing `before` will cause errors. This will be fixed in future versions.

## Roadmap

I would like to create test cases for this plugin, ideally eventually using this plugin itself. Unfortunately, I just can't seem to figure out how to convert `scripted` from an `InputKey` into a `TaskKey` so that I can execute it with `Project.runTask`. I keep getting errors no matter what arguments I pass into `scripted.toTask`. I'll be really grateful if anyone can point me in the right direction.

When SBT 1.0.x is released, it should be possible to automatically generate the `test` script file, removing the need for [Step 4](#step-4-configure-test-script).
